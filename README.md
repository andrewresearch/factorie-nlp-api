# nlpfactorie

This is a modified version of [https://github.com/factorie/factorie](https://github.com/factorie/factorie) focused on the NLP features via the API.
Therefore, it is missing all of the command line code, code for accessing MongoDB, and the docs associated with the general (non NLP) use of Factorie.
I also removed the custom sbt builder, and replaced it with a standard ```build.sbt```

It compiles under Scala 2.12.3
